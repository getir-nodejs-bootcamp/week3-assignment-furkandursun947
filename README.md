In this homework, I made my own API in my live server with express.

- In app.js, I take the requests from Postman. Then send necessary requests to my API that works in localhost:8080 as well. My API works in /productAPI endpoint. 

- In server.js, I create the server and also I have a global array that acts like a DB. I also have a middleware for checking token. (verify_token)
In here, I take the requests that is coming from app.js.
